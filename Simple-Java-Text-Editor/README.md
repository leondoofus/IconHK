# Simple Java Text Editor

**PH NotePad** is a simple and light **text editor** (notepad) written in Java.

- Search tool (to search text/keywords easily in the code) + highlighting the code found

- Find/Replace text/code

- Auto completion for Java and C++ keywords (files need to be saved as *.java*/*.cpp*). It can be easily expanded to support pretty much any number of languages.

- Nice image buttons for better UX
